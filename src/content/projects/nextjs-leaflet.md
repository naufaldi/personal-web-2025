## Overview

A practical Next.js project demonstrating the integration of Leaflet, a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. This project serves as a reference implementation and companion to the blog tutorial series.

## Purpose

This project was created to provide:

- **Practical Examples**: Real-world implementations of Leaflet with Next.js
- **Tutorial Reference**: Code examples accompanying blog articles
- **Best Practices**: How to properly integrate mapping libraries in modern applications
- **Reusable Components**: Components that can be used in other projects

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework with server-side rendering
- **Leaflet**: Open-source JavaScript mapping library
- **React**: Component-based UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **GeoJSON**: Format for geographic data

## Key Features

### Interactive Maps
