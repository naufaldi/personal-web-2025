This is my first time creating an open journal about my journey. I've been thinking about it for a while, especially after seeing my senior, Mas Didik, share his own experience. It made me wonder: why not do it myself? This is my first time being laid off and unemployed, and I want to focus on my thoughts, skills, and how I’m navigating through this challenging time. So, here it goes.

It’s been a week since I was laid off on February 13, and now it’s February 20. My main focus is on making a smooth transition. I still have some part-time work to finish, but aside from that, I’ve been replying to messages and applying for jobs via LinkedIn. I’ve been using the easy apply option because I still don’t feel confident in my current skills—especially with languages, backend development, algorithms, and data structures. Despite facing rejections, I am determined to prove my worth.

Even if a company offers me an interview, I’m taking the chance. As I’m writing this from a coffee shop, I’ve just registered for Japanese language classes at Cetta Japanese to ensure that I’m focusing on things that are important to me. Additionally, I’ve received responses from companies, including an invitation to take a ReactJS test via HackerRank.

For now, if a company hasn’t reached out for an interview, I won’t include it on my tracking list. I prefer to keep it manageable.

Honestly, the past few days have been a bit unproductive. I’ve spent too much time watching movies and playing games. I’ve been wondering why I haven’t been able to get involved in learning. It feels like there’s no push or encouragement to get started.

I’m not sure what’s going on with me, and I feel like I might need some external motivation. Maybe going outside more often could help me become more disciplined and provide the push I need to start learning again.

I know I need to push myself to the limit. My focus must shift to learning, especially while I’m working on my part-time projects. I plan to continue with my GitHub projects and take courses on Udemy. I also want to try working from a coffee shop to stay productive. Plus, I’m planning to meet with a few seniors for 1:1 sessions to stay motivated and gain insights.

Here’s my to-do list:

*   Learn Japanese at Cetta
*   Continue learning backend development by working on my booking project ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/naufaldi?tab=repositories&ref=blog.faldi.xyz))
*   Learn data structures and algorithms from the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/?ref=blog.faldi.xyz)
*   Solve easy-level problems on Leetcode
*   Work from a coffee shop to stay productive
*   Schedule 1:1 sessions with senior professionals for insights and motivation

I hope this routine helps me become more productive and focused during this challenging time.
