Baldur Gate 3

Currently, there are two types of games that I enjoy:

*   **Story-driven Games**
*   **Strategy Games**

The games I prefer must have specific gameplay elements that I enjoy. For story-driven games, they need to have gameplay similar to _Baldur's Gate 3_ with a turn-based mode, or an open world like _Red Dead Redemption 2_ or _Skyrim_. These games have made me truly appreciate narrative-driven experiences. Before that, I didn’t care much about the story—playing a game wasn’t like reading a novel to me. But _Baldur's Gate 3_ completely shifted my perspective, showing me how a powerful narrative can profoundly enhance the gameplay experience.

That game is truly a masterpiece, and I now understand why _Baldur's Gate 3_ won Game of the Year. The combination of the story, gameplay, and graphics is simply exceptional.

Playing _Baldur's Gate 3_ was also my first introduction to something called tabletop games or D&D (Dungeons & Dragons). It’s a game where the Dungeon Master guides the story and sets the rules, using imagination and creativity. Experiencing that kind of dynamic, where the world unfolds based on your choices, was a new and thrilling experience for me, making me feel more connected and excited as I played. It also opened my mind to how much a game can involve storytelling, not just actions.

When it comes to strategy games, the first one I got into was _Age of Empires_, which was also the first game I ever played. From there, I moved on to _Red Alert_, and even today, I still enjoy playing _Age of Empires IV_. However, during my bachelor’s degree, I discovered new publishers like Paradox Interactive and Creative Assembly, which completely transformed my approach to strategy games.

Someone who play Byzantium, Twist history itself

These developers gave me a new perspective on strategy games, particularly **Grand Strategy**. These games focus on managing military, politics, and entire nations. I love how they force me to think critically about resources and relationships, something that has broadened my real-world understanding of economics and politics. For example:

*   **Learning economics** through games gives me a rough outline of how logistics and trade function, even if the details aren't precise. It's fascinating how games can simulate these systems, providing practical knowledge.
*   **Politics and intrigue** in these games showcase the delicate balancing act between nations. They teach me about relationships and how to manage alliances, which in a way mirrors how we interact with people in real life.

In Grand Strategy games, planning ahead is crucial. Take _Europa Universalis IV_, for instance. If you can’t directly defeat the Ottomans as the Mamluks, a smart strategy is to ally with smaller bordering nations, attack together, and slowly chip away at their power. But the challenge lies in making sure those small nations don’t turn on you, which adds an extra layer of complexity. That kind of planning and foresight has sharpened my decision-making skills.

Become Elf Warrior

For me, playing games is more than just entertainment; it's a coping mechanism—an escape from reality where I can become "somebody else."

Playing _Baldur's Gate 3_? You can become a martial artist monk fighting against evil. You can help the people in the Emerald Grove, search for a cure for the illithid infection, and face even greater threats as the story progresses.

Playing _Europa Universalis IV_? You can become the Ottoman Empire, conquer lands from Constantinople to Iberia, control trade nodes, and become a military superpower with a massive navy and army.

This is what I love about games—they transport me into different roles and worlds, allowing me to experience life from new perspectives.

All DLC EU4

However, my biggest issue with these games is the **DLC**. It’s something that really frustrates me. The prices for DLCs usually start at 100,000 to 200,000 Rupiah, which can sometimes be almost 50% of the base game price. This makes me think twice before purchasing them. I usually wait until there’s a significant discount or subscribe temporarily when I want to dive deep into a specific game.

The reason I love strategy games is not just for the gameplay but for the lessons they offer:

*   **Learning about economics** helps me understand broader concepts, even if not in detail.
*   **Navigating political intrigue** helps me learn how to build alliances and manage relationships, offering wisdom applicable to real life.

Yet, there’s a downside. Sometimes, I get too obsessed. It turns into an addiction or even feels like a chore. I find myself constantly chasing big achievements in the game, which can drain the fun out of it. I become so focused on not losing that it almost feels like a curse—it's no longer enjoyable, but I still feel compelled to achieve something.

Isn’t that ironic?
