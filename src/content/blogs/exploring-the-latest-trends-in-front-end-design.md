In recent years, front-end design has undergone a rapid evolution, with new technologies and techniques emerging at a rapid pace. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the latest trends in front-end design, and explore how they can be used to create modern, user-friendly websites.

### Micro-interactions

Micro-interactions One of the most exciting trends in front-end design is the use of micro-interactions. These are small interactive elements on a website that provide feedback to users, such as buttons that change color when clicked or form fields that shake when an error occurs. Micro-interactions are becoming increasingly popular because they provide a more engaging and interactive user experience.

### Dark Mode

Dark mode is another trend that is becoming more prevalent in front-end design. Dark mode is a design feature that inverts the colors on a website, making the background dark and the text light. This is becoming more popular as users become more conscious of the effect of screens on their eyes.
