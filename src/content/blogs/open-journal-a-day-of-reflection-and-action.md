### Recap Yesterday

Warung Bakmi jawa Mas Yono

Yesterday, I spent most of the day working from the café with friends. Afterward, we had dinner at Bakmi Pak Yono, followed by a visit to a coffee shop to hang out. Although it wasn’t a particularly productive day in terms of work, I enjoyed the time spent catching up with people. I had conversations with Mas Pras, Vento, and others, just chatting and having a good time. Since I’m an extrovert, I felt energized by the interaction, and it gave me a much-needed boost.

The highlight of the day came in the evening when I received a call for an interview with a company in the US. I’m processing it as usual, and it’s a good opportunity. Alongside that, I booked a 1:1 session with Mas Didik from my university. He’s been instrumental in shaping my perspective on engineering, especially in the early stages of my career, and I look forward to gaining more insights from him.

### Today Story

Productiv with Coffe

It’s now 13:18 at Senayan City. When I talk about "work," I don’t necessarily mean full-time or part-time employment. To me, "work" encompasses any activity that contributes to learning, growth, or career development. Life itself involves a wide range of things—eating, falling in love, playing games, hanging out with friends—and sometimes, I need to find a balance between these aspects. This balance is important to staying productive in both work and personal life.

Today, I’m working from Senayan City, as my significant other needs me to accompany her to attend two events in the afternoon and evening. While this will drain some of my energy and shift my focus away from coding, I’m willing to make that sacrifice. After all, we work to live, not the other way around.

Despite the shift in focus, I’m determined to stay productive. My goals for today include catching up on coding, particularly with my part-time job and the take-home test. This will be a challenge, as I need to maintain the quality of my part-time work while also tackling the test and addressing the tasks I missed yesterday, such as solving LeetCode problems and reading some technical articles. Additionally, I’m looking forward to the 1:1 with Mas Didik, as it will provide me with a valuable opportunity to gain new perspectives.

### What Will You Do

Based on my plans for today, here’s what I will focus on:

*   Start solving problems on LeetCode, even if it’s just one
*   Complete the take-home test
*   Use Wakatime to track my coding sessions
*   Set up the environment on my MacBook (since it restarted after I bought it back from the office)
*   Have the 1:1 session with Mas Didik
*   Work on my part-time job, which I didn’t get to yesterday

I’m considering whether I should work late into the night or sleep early and wake up refreshed. I’ll just see how it goes and adjust as needed.
