- **Confidence scores**: Display model confidence levels
- **Visual explanations**: Use charts and visualizations to illustrate decisions

## Documentation

Maintain comprehensive records of model development and decision-making processes:

- Document training data sources
- Record model architecture decisions
- Track performance metrics over time
- Keep change logs for model updates

## User Communication

Inform users about how AI decisions are made and their implications:

- Clear privacy policies
- Transparent terms of service
- User-friendly explanations
- Options to opt-out or request human review

## Best Practices

- **Regular audits**: Review and update transparency measures
- **User feedback**: Collect and act on user concerns
