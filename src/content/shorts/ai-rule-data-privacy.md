## Data Minimization

Collect only necessary data:

- **Purpose limitation**: Only collect data for specific, legitimate purposes
- **Data retention**: Delete data when no longer needed
- **Minimal collection**: Avoid collecting excessive or unnecessary information
- **Anonymization**: Remove personally identifiable information when possible

## User Consent

Obtain explicit consent for data usage:

- **Clear consent**: Use plain language to explain data usage
- **Granular controls**: Allow users to choose what data to share
- **Easy opt-out**: Provide simple mechanisms to withdraw consent
- **Consent records**: Maintain records of user consent

## Data Security

Implement robust security measures to protect data:

- **Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
