# AI Rule: Avoid Bias in Training Data

To ensure fairness in AI models, it's crucial to avoid bias in training data. This involves several key practices:

## Diverse Data Collection

Gather data from varied sources to represent all user groups. Ensure your dataset includes:

- Different demographics
- Various geographic locations
- Multiple perspectives and viewpoints
- Balanced representation across categories

## Bias Detection

Use tools to identify and mitigate bias in datasets:

- **Statistical analysis**: Check for distribution imbalances
- **Bias detection tools**: Leverage specialized ML tools
- **Human review**: Have diverse teams review training data

## Regular Audits

Continuously monitor models for biased outcomes and retrain as necessary:

- Track model performance across different groups
- Set up automated monitoring systems
- Establish review cycles for model updates

## Best Practices

- **Data augmentation**: Use techniques to balance underrepresented groups
- **Fairness metrics**: Define and track fairness KPIs
- **Transparency**: Document your data collection and processing methods
